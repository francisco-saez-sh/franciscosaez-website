# 🌐 Static Website on AWS S3

This is a simple static website developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, originally created as the homepage for my personal music project. I used it as a practical exercise to reinforce my cloud knowledge after obtaining the **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner** certification.

The site is now deployed on **Amazon S3** using the Static Website Hosting feature.

- Build a website for my personal music project  
- Get hands-on experience with S3 and bucket permissions
- Understand static hosting configuration
- Practice deploying and managing static assets in the cloud
- Explore how to integrate GitHub for version control and documentation

## 🙋 About Me

I'm a Telecommunications Engineer with experience in software engineering and a strong interest in cloud technologies. After spending a few years working professionally as a music producer and audio engineer, I'm now refocusing on IT — particularly on gaining hands-on experience with AWS and modern cloud infrastructure.

This project bridges both worlds: my background in music and my current journey into the cloud.
